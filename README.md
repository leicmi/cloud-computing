## Lamq

A simple command line interface to submit jobs

### Building

Build the CLI with `go build -o ./lamq`.

### Running

Just executing `./lamq` gives you the instructions how to use the tool! Some commands require some AWS configuration to be present, which is expected to be in `config.yml`. There is a sample config which can be copied to that location and be filled in.
